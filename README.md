  <h1>HackerRank C++ Journey</h1>
  
  <h2>From 1 Star to 3 Stars</h2>
  
  <p>This repository documents my journey on HackerRank, where I progressed from a 1-star rating to reaching a 3-star rating in the C++ programming language. The goal of this journey was to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of C++, and tackle a variety of coding challenges available on HackerRank.</p>
  
  <h2>Progression</h2>
  
  <p>Here's a breakdown of my journey, highlighting the concepts and topics I covered at each star level:</p>
  
  <h3>1 Star</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Basic input/output operations</li>
    <li>Conditional statements and loops</li>
    <li>Arrays and strings</li>
    <li>Basic mathematical calculations</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>2 Stars</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced data structures (e.g., vectors, sets, maps)</li>
    <li>Functions and recursion</li>
    <li>Pointers and memory management</li>
    <li>File handling and I/O operations</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3 Stars</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)</li>
    <li>Standard Template Library (STL) usage</li>
    <li>Advanced algorithms and data structures (e.g., sorting, searching, graphs)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>If you're starting your own C++ journey on HackerRank, here are some steps to follow:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Create a HackerRank account at <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">https://www.hackerrank.com</a></li>
    <li>Choose the C++ language track</li>
    <li>Start solving problems from the "Easy" difficulty level and gradually progress to higher difficulty levels</li>
    <li>Analyze the problem statements, design efficient algorithms, and implement solutions in C++</li>
    <li>Test your solutions with HackerRank's provided test cases and verify correctness</li>
    <li>Optimize your code for better time and space complexity</li>
    <li>Learn from the editorial solutions and discuss problem-solving strategies with the community</li>
  </ol>
